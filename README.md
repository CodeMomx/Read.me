<h2> Hello! My name is Brittany and I am a Full-stack Developer.</h2>

<p>Becoming a first-generation college graduate, from Rutgers University was the first stride I took towards being both adaptable and innovative in my career endeavors. Working as an AML consultant for over nine years for various international banking institutions and cryptocurrency platforms in both Risk and Compliance, allowed for me the opportunity to work with various people from all walks of life. My responsibilities included designing and implementing a new Know Your Customer (KYC) process for a banking institution that did not have an existing team in place. The implementation resulted in a reduction in 30 million dollars of institutional funds circumvented by means of fraud, anti-money laundering or shell companies, just to name a few. The more time I spent with working as an analyst and learning new systems and technology, the more I realized was ready for a career change into becoming a Software Engineer. Hiring me would make me a great candidate for your company because I work from a risk mitigation model that allows for me to be an direct asset to the team.
